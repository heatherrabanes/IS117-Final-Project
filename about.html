        <p>Starpop Showdown is a single-player story-based rhythm game revolving around Star,
         an aspiring idol who faces other rivals. The game was created in the Fall of 2022
        and debuted in December at the 2022 Digital Design Game Expo in the Hillier College of
        Architecture Design building. The full game was planned to have 4 playable levels including
            the tutorial in total. Currently, only the demo, which contains the tutorial level,
            is available. It is possible that the full game may one day be developed in the future!</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Story</h2>
        <img class="interior-image" src="images/starpop%20story.png">
        <figcaption>A cutscene illustration from the game.</figcaption>
        <br>
        <p><em>Star is a young girl from Toronto who, after her time at a boring private school,
            aspires to become a famous popstar. However, she quickly finds that she has to compete with
            other established stars of their own domain. Can she outshine her rivals?
        </em></p>
        <p>Starpop Showdown features different cutscenes that are unlocked as the player progresses through
         the levels of the game. The player passes each level, or performance, by pressing the
        buttons A, S, D, or F to the proper timing. </p>
        <p> The first cutscene introduces Star and her backstory. In the first level, Star must perform
            successfully at her debut. In the levels after that, Star must perform sufficiently alongside
        her rivals in order to win their respect. The second level introduces Selene, a rock star. The
        third level introduces Halley, a DJ/dance star. The final level introduces Estelle, an opera star.
         The premise of the story runs under the theme of competition, but as the player follows Star's journey,
        the characters discover the values of camaraderie and friendship.</p>
        <br>
